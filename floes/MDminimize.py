Minimize an OpenMM-ready solvated complex

Ex: python floes/openmm_prepMDminimize.py --system complex.oeb --ofs-data_out min.oeb --steps 1000`

Parameters:
-----------
complex (file): OEB file of the prepared system

Optional:
--------
steps (int): Number of MD steps to minimize the system. If 0 until convergence will be reached

Outputs:
--------
ofs: Outputs the minimized system
